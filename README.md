# HTML Forms

*In this project you'll get a chance to rebuild the form used by [Mint.com](https://mint.intuit.com/) for signing up new users... don't worry abut any of the dynamic functionality... the point is to make it look like the real page as much as you reasonably can*

## Status

Complete. This will not be hosted on Github Pages as it mimics a live site and will be flagged as a security concern by Github.
